This repository contains the source code for [FluentCI](https://fluentci.io) services.
Services are processes that run in the background and provide functionality that you might need to test or operate your application in a CI/CD pipeline.
For example, your CI/CD Pipeline might need to run tests that require access to a database and memory cache.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the following command to start a service locally or on your CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
fluentci run --wasm <service> start
```

Example:

```bash
fluentci run --wasm postgres start
```

## ‚ú® Features

- **Lightweight**: Services are built using WebAssembly and can run on Linux/MacOS without any additional dependencies or installations, making them lightweight and easy to use.
- **Isolated**: Each service runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that they do not interfere with existing services or applications on your machine.
- **Customizable**: Services can be customized to suit your needs by modifying the source code, configuration files or environment variables.
