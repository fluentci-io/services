This repository contains the source code for [FluentCI](https://fluentci.io) services.
Services are processes that run in the background and provide functionality that you might need to test or operate your application in a CI/CD pipeline.
For example, your CI/CD Pipeline might need to run tests that require access to a database and memory cache.
